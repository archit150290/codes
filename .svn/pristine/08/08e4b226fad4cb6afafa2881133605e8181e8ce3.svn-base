                                    <li>Reinforcements are more effective than rewards (although latter are important as well)</li>
                                    <li>Immediate Effect vs. Prospect of a Reward</li>
                                    <li>The more immediate, the Better</li>
                                    <li>Rate of change is directly proportional to the number of reinforces received</li>
