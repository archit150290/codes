        <p><span style="font-family: Arial,serif;" data-mce-style="font-family: Arial,serif;">These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Louisiana, exclusive of its choice of law rules. In any action to enforce these terms and conditions, the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. Nothing in these Terms of Use limits either party's ability to seek equitable relief. The Company shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs in connection with enforcing any provision of these Terms of Use. No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition, and any failure by the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company with respect to the Site, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements. If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in effect. Some states do not allow exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. In such states, our liability and that of our third-party content providers and their respective agents shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</span>
